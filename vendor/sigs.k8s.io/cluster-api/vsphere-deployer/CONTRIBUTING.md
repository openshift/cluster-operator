# Contributing Guidelines

## Prerequisites

### Install terraform

Install terraform as per [instructions](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html).

### Install Google Cloud SDK (gcloud)

Google Cloud SDK (gcloud) will be helpful for setting credentials to push the controller image to GCR.

Steps to follow:
1.  Install as per [Cloud SDK instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/);
2.  Configure Cloud SDK to point to the GCP project you will be using.

    ```bash
    $ gcloud config set project <GCP_PROJECT_ID>
    ```

### Set GCP Credentials

In order to develop the vSphere machine controller, you need to configure the credentials to push a newer version of the controller to GCR.

You can set it in two ways, as explained below.

#### Environment Variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS

Steps to follow:
1. Verify that the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` is set pointing to valid service account credentials
2. If not set, follow the [instructions on Google Cloud Platform site](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) to have it set up.

#### Login Using Cloud SDK

The alternative is to set the client credentials via gcloud by executing the command line below.

```bash
$ gcloud auth application-default login
```

### Install Docker

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) on your machine;
2. Make sure your user can execute docker commmands (without sudo). This is a way to test it:
```bash
$ docker run hello-world

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
...
```

3. Run `gcloud beta auth configure-docker` to configure your credentials.

### Install OpenSSL

Install [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/source/) on your machine. Please note that this is just temporary. We are working to remove this dependency. See [Issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-deploy/issues/591)

## Fetch Source Code

1. Fork [cluster-api repo](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api). If it's your first time forking, please take a look at [GitHub Repo instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/). The general [Kubernetes GitHub workflow](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/github-workflow.md) is helpful here too if you're getting started.

2. Clone Repo Locally
```bash
$ cd $GOPATH/src/sigs.k8s.io/
$ git clone https://github.com/<GITHUB_USERNAME>/cluster-api.git
```

## Build

```bash
$ cd $GOPATH/src/sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/vsphere-deployer/
$ go build
```

This will create a binary `vsphere-deployer` in the same directory. You can use that binary to manage a cluster.

## Developing

When making changes to the machine controller, it's generally a good idea to delete any existing cluster created with an older version of the cluster-api.

Note: the below command is not yet implemented.

```bash
$ ./vsphere-deployer delete
```

After making changes to the controllers or the actuator, you need to follow these two steps:

1. Rebuild the machine-controller image. Also change `machineControllerImage` in `cloud/terraform/pods.go` to the new image path (make sure the version in the Makefile and `pods.go` match if you want to use the new image). Then, rebuild and push the image.

	```bash
	$ cd $GOPATH/src/sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/cloud/vsphere/cmd/vsphere-machine-controller
	$ make dev_push
	```

NOTE: that the image will be pushed to `gcr.io/$GCP_PROJECT/vsphere-machine-controller`. Image storage is a billable resource.

2. Rebuild vsphere-deployer

    ```bash
    $ cd $GOPATH/src/sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/vsphere-deployer/
    $ go build
    ```

The new `vsphere-deployer` will have your changes.

## Testing

We do not have unit tests or integration tests currently. For any changes, it is recommended that you test a create-edit-delete sequence using the new machine controller image and the new `vsphere-deployer` binary.

1. Generate machines configuration file.

1. Create a cluster

	```bash
	$ ./vsphere-deployer create -c cluster.yaml -m machines.yaml -n vsphere_named_machines.yaml
	```

[Optional]To verify API server has been deployed successfully, you can the following command to double check.
    
    ```bash
    $ kubectl get apiservices v1alpha1.cluster.k8s.io -o yaml
    ```
    
2. Edit the machine to trigger an update

	```bash
	$ kubectl edit machine $MACHINE_NAME
	```

3. Make sure the new behavior is working as intended. Then delete the cluster.

	```bash
	$ ./vsphere-deployer delete
	```
